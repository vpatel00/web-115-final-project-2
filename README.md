# Caesar Cipher Encryption/Decryption

This web program uses JS to encrypt or decrypt a Caesar Cipher based on the user's chosen shift and direction.
To use this program, download the index.html and script.js files and place them in the same directory. Open index.html in a web browser to use the program.

An alternate version of the program is available in the "alternate" directory in this repository. The difference is that you only give it a message and it shifts in the direction and number of letters that you tell it to, instead of "encrypting" or "decrypting" based on a certain cipher. To decrypt something that is encrypted to the right, you would have to change it to left, while in the main version of the program it uses the original cipher and you can choose whether to encrypt or decrypt. The alternate version has encrypt and decrypt buttons, but they don't actually do anything apart from changing the submit button.
